# Simple-chaining-hashing-project
a structure representing student information consisting of the following:

    Student name
    Student ID (integer)
    Student date of birth in 3 integers (day, month, year)
    Student score of last year (integer)
we used a hash function that maps the data to the hash table using student's name by making summation of the ASCII number of each letter and make it mod table size.

We developed functions to insert, delete, find an element in the hash table.
